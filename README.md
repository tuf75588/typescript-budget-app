# A Simple React Budgeting App

The motivation behind this project is continuing to bolster my experience and understanding working with React and TypeScript together. As a big fan of the
LearnInPublic movement, I will do my best to document my code and explain my reasoning for certain patterns throughout this app.

Thanks for checking this out, and please be on the lookout for new TypeScript focused projects soon!

## TODO

- [x] Install needed dependencies
- [x] organize files
- [ ] setup main app component
